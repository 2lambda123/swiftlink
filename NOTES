Aside from writing the missing code I need to :


    replace all pointers with references where it makes sense

    const-correctness (do any of the valgrind tools help with this?)

    think about flow of otherall application
        - ie: deps: person needs diseasemodel to init
                    but objects are as a result of reading different config files
                    need to make sure that everything can be created as placeholders as well
                    so I don't need to read in the linkage file to test anything that 
                    reads the pedfile

    modularise (namespaces? overkill?)
        - parsers
        - peeling
        - haplotype
        - linkage
        - core (ie: to linkage and hap)
        - samplers(?)
